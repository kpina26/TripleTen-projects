# Sprint_4_Project

## This project is a Vehicle Price & Condition Analysis Dashboard built using Streamlit. The dashboard provides visual insights into vehicle pricing trends, the relationship between vehicle make and paint color, and the distribution of vehicle conditions across different model years. By leveraging interactive visualizations, users can explore how different factors influence vehicle pricing and market trends. Utilizing Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization, overcoming challenges like data cleaning, performance optimization and deployment on Render. for future enhancement plans with Machine Learning Models to predict vehicle prices based on user input. Using UI/UX with better filtering options and user customization. Adding more data sources to enhance the accuracy and reliability of insights.

## To install and run the Vehicle Price & Condition Analysis Dashboard, follow these steps: clone the repository, navigate to the project folder, optionally set up a virtual environment, install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt (or manually install streamlit, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy if the file is missing), then start the application with streamlit run app.py and access the dashboard in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

## To use the Vehicle Price & Condition Analysis Dashboard, open the application in your browser after running streamlit run app.py, explore interactive visualizations on vehicle pricing trends, paint color distributions, and condition variations, hover over charts for detailed insights, and utilize future enhancements like machine learning predictions and advanced filtering for deeper analysis.
